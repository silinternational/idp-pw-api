Backend API for Identity Provider Password Management

## Build Status
[![Codeship Status for silinternational/idp-pw-api](https://codeship.com/projects/6e239250-bed3-0133-700c-329cf2fde74f/status?branch=develop)](https://codeship.com/projects/137021)
[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/silinternational/idp-pw-api/badges/quality-score.png?b=develop)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/silinternational/idp-pw-api/?branch=develop)

## Dev Requirements

### Linux
1. Docker >= 1.9.1
2. Docker Compose >= 1.5

### Mac
1. Docker for Mac Beta

### Windows
1. VirtualBox
2. Vagrant
3. Alternative to using vagrant you can install Docker Toolbox, but Docker Compose
   still has issues with Windows and doesn't support interactive mode at this time.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Copy ```local.env.dist``` to ```local.env``` and ```email.local.env.dist```
   to ```email.local.env``` and update values in each as appropriate.
3. Setup environment variable for ```DOCKER_UIDGID``` in the format of ```"uid:gid"```.
   This will run some of the containers as you so that they can write to your host filesystem
   and the file permissions will be owned by you.
4. Setup environment variable for ```COMPOSER_CONFIG_FILE``` with the full system path
   to your composer config.json file, for example: ```/home/my/.composer/config.json```.
   This will allow the composer container to use your github auth token when pulling dependencies.
5. (OPTIONAL) Copy ```application/common/config/local.php.dist``` to ```application/common/config/local.php```
   and update with appropriate settings
6. Follow operating system specific steps below
7. You should be able to access the API using a REST client or your browser
   at http://idp-pw-api.local:8080.
8. You'll probably also want the web interface for this application which you can
   clone at <https://github.com/silinternational/idp-profile-ui>

### Additional setup for Linux & Mac
1. Add entry to ```/etc/hosts``` for ```127.0.0.1 idp-pw-api.local```
2. Run ```docker build -t idp-pw-api .```
3. Run ```make start```

### Additional setup for Windows
1. Add entry to ```c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts``` for
   ```192.168.37.37 idp-pw-api.local```
2. Run ```vagrant up```
3. In order to run docker commands directly, SSH into the vagrant box ```vagrant ssh```
   change to /vagrant folder ```cd /vagrant``` and run ```make start```

### Makefile script aliases
To simplify common tasks there is a Makefile in place. The most common tasks will likely be:

- ```make start``` - Does what is needed to get API server online
- ```make test``` - Does cleanup and restart of test instances and runs unit tests
- ```make clean``` - Remove all containers
- ```make composerupdate``` - ```make start``` will run a ```composer install```, but to update composer
    you need to run ```make composerupdate```

## Component Architecture
With the goal of being reusable, this application is developed with a component based architecture that allows swapping out specific components to suit your needs. All components must implement common interfaces to support this and new components can be developed to implement the interface as needed.

### Common Interfaces and Classes
The interfaces for the following components are stored within the [application/common/components](./application/common/components) source tree.

### Configuration
All components must extend from [\yii\base\Component](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-structure-application-components.html) so that they can be configured in the ```components``` section of the application configuration. This also allows them to be accessed via ```\Yii::$app->componentId```. While each component has a defined interface for methods to implement, what properties it needs for configuration are up to each implementation as appropriate. See [our common/config/local.php.dist](https://github.com/silinternational/idp-pw-api/blob/develop/application/common/config/local.php.dist) for examples of configurations.

### Authentication Component
We use SAML for authentication but this component can be replaced to support whatever method is needed. For example an auth component could be written to implement OAuth or use Google, etc.

* Component ID: ```auth```
* Implement interface: ```common\components\auth\AuthnInterface```
* [Example implementation](application/common/components/auth/Saml.php)

### Password Store Component
You can store your passwords wherever you like, whether it is LDAP, Active Directory, a database, or even Redis.

* Component ID: ```passwordstore```
* Implement interface: ```common\components\passwordStore\PasswordStoreInterface```
* [Example implementation](application/common/components/passwordStore/Ldap.php)

### Personnel Component
The personnel component is used to look up informaton about users from your company's personnel system. This includes verifying that they are an active employee, getting information about them like name, email, employee id, whether they have a supervisor and what their supervisors email address is. If the personnel system is aware of spouses it can also provide the spouse's email address.

* Component ID: ```personnel```
* Implement interface: ```common\components\personnel\PersonnelInterface```
* [Example implementation](application/common/components/personnel/IdBroker.php)

### passwordStore/Google component
 Password store component for IdP PW API that uses Google as the backend.

#### To Use

1. Create a project on <https://console.developers.google.com/>.
2. Still in the Google Developers Console, create a Service Account.
3. Check "Furnish a new private key" and "Enable G Suite Domain-wide Delegation".
4. Save the JSON file it provides (containing your private key), but **DO NOT**
   store it in public version control (such as in a public GitHub repo).
5. Enable the "Admin SDK" API for your project in the Google Developers Console.
6. Have an admin for the relevant Google Apps domain go to
   <http://admin.google.com/> and, under Security, Advanced, Manage API Client
   Access, grant your Client ID access to the following scope:  
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user`
7. Set up a delegated admin account in Google Apps, authorized to make changes
   to users. You will use that email address as the value for an env. var.
8. See the `local.env.dist` file to know what environment variables to provide
   when using this library.

#### Example Configuration

    $googlePasswordStore = new GooglePasswordStore([
        
        // Required config fields (dummy values are shown here):
        'applicationName' => 'Name of Your Application',
        'delegatedAdminEmail' => 'some_admin@yourgoogledomain.com',
        
        // You must provide one of these two fields:
        'jsonAuthConfigBase64' => '...', // A base64-encoded string of the JSON
                                         // auth file provided by Google.
        'jsonAuthFilePath' => '/somewhere/in/your/filesystem/google-auth.json',
        
        // Optional config fields (current defaults are shown here):
        'emailFieldName' => 'email',
        'employeeIdFieldName' => 'employee_id',
        'userActiveRecordClass' => '\common\models\User',
    ]);

For details about what each of those fields is used for, see the documenting
comments in the `/src/Google.php` file.

## API Documentation
The API is described by [api.raml](api.raml), and an auto-generated [api.html](api.html) created by
`raml2html`. To regenerate the HTML file, run `make raml2html`. To view the
rendered HTML file on Github, prepend the Github URL with 
`https://htmlpreview.github.com/?`.
[Example](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/silinternational/idp-pw-api/blob/develop-3.0/api.html)

### Quick start for manually interacting with API
To quickly get up and running to verify basic operation of the API, these are a 
few endpoints to start with. GET endpoints can be exercised with any browser,
but others will need something like [Insomnia](http://insomnia.rest).

#### `GET /config`

Returns configuration parameters supplied by environment variables.

#### `GET /site/system-status`

This endpoint verifies connectivity to the database and to the email service.

#### `POST /reset` and `PUT /reset/{uid}/validate`

This combination requires connection to a PasswordStore component and a Personnel
component containing a valid user record. After sending the `POST`, retrieve the reset 
code from the email or the database, and the reset uid from the response body, then
supply them in the `PUT` request body and URI. The response will contain an 
`access_token` to use for subsequent calls that require it.

#### `GET /auth/login`

This method of authentication will provide a full-scope `access_token`. The easiest
method is to use an `invite` code, which can be found in the ID Broker database after
creating a new user. The `access_token` can be found in the `Location` response header.

## Test configuration
Tests are configured in multiple places, using different test frameworks.
